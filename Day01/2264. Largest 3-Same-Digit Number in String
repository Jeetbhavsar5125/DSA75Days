Problem Description
You are given a string num representing a large integer.

An integer is good if:

It is a substring of length 3 of num.

It consists of only one unique digit (all three digits are the same).

Return the maximum good integer as a string, or "" if no such integer exists.

Note:

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Leading zeros are allowed in num and good integers.
